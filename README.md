TempFileShare – Upload & Share Files Instantly 🚀
🔹 Project Description

TempFileShare is a lightweight and secure file-sharing web application built with Python Flask. It allows users to upload files and generate shareable links that automatically expire after a set time or when file size limits are reached.

With future-ready features, users can:

⚡ Upload files instantly with a clean and simple UI

🔗 Get a unique, secure download link to share with anyone

⏳ Set custom link expiration (time-based)

📏 Define file size limits to control uploads

🛡️ Ensure privacy with automatic file deletion after expiration
